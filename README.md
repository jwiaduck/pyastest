pyastest
===========================
a command line tool to compare Python ASTs

# Quick start
Note: Developed with Python 3.9.10 .
Note: Rudimentally tested. Proceed with caution!

```console
$ git clone <this repo>
$ cd pyastest
$ python3 pyastest.py path/to/file1 path/to/file2
Starting...
...
True: ASTs are equal!
Done!
```

I plan to build both this comparison tool as well as other tools utilizing Abstract Syntax Trees in this repository.
